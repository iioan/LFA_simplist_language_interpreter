# Teme LFA - Formal Languages and Automata Assignments
Ioan Teodorescu (333CB)
This repository contains all 4 assignments completed for the Formal Languages and Automata course.

The assignments cover various aspects of theoretical computer science, specifically focusing on formal languages and automata:

1. **NFA-to-DFA Conversion (Subset Construction Algorithm)**: This assignment implements the Subset Construction Algorithm, which is a method for converting a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The details of this implementation can be found in the file `README_step1.md`.
2. **Regex-to-NFA Conversion (Thompson's Algorithm)**: This assignment focuses on implementing Thompson's Algorithm, which is a technique for converting a regular expression into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). The provided code for this assignment is explained in the file `README_step2.md`.
3. **Lexer Implementation**: This assignment delves into the creation of a lexer, which is a program that breaks down a sequence of characters (like source code) into meaningful elements (like tokens). The implementation details for the lexer are specified in the file `README_step3.md`.
4. **Lisp-inspired Language Interpreter (Bonus)**: As an optional bonus assignment, this section explores the implementation of an interpreter for a language resembling Lisp. The provided interpreter is explained in the file `README_bonus.md`.

It's important to note that all of the assignments in this repository were implemented using `Python 3.12`. To run the included unit tests, you can use the following command in your terminal:
```
python3.12 -m unittest
```
I hope this extended version provides a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the repository's contents and purpose.
